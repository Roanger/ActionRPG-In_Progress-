# ActionRPG: Project Overpowered

An Action RPG inspired by genre giants like *Path of Exile* and *Torchlight Infinite*. Start from nothing and engineer the ultimate Overpowered Robot.

## 📖 Lore
In a distant future, humanity is nothing but a memory preserved in scattered books and works of art. The world they left behind is a landscape of rubble and ancient ruins.

In this new era, organic life has ceased. The only inhabitants are Robots—both friend and foe.

## 🤖 Features
- **Zero to Hero**: Start with nothing and build an Overpowered Robot.
- **5 Starting Classes**: Choose from 5 different classes to begin your journey.
- **Robotic World**: All characters, NPCs, and enemies are robots living in the ruins of human civilization.
